and who are you the proud lord said
that i must bow so low
only a cat of a different coat
that s all the truth i know
in a coat of gold or a coat of red
a lion still has claws
and mine are long and sharp my lord
as long and sharp as yours
and so he spoke and so he spoke
that lord of castamere
but now the rains weep o er his hall
with no one there to hear
yes now the rains weep o er his hall
and not a soul to hear
